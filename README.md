# Project set up and installation

Because the time is very limit so i'm using Create React App and UI Component for the best development speed.

## Installation

```bash
npm install or yarn install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

I also deploy it with vercel for if you don't wanna run the whole project.
You can visit it in [Teko Interview](https://tienphuc-teko-interview.vercel.app/)
